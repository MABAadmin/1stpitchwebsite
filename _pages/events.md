Presenting at 1st Pitch Life Science allows early stage life science entrepreneurs to:
<ul>
 	<li>Try out a pitch where no money is immediately at stake</li>
 	<li>Hear what investors and audience members think of their presentation and opportunity</li>
 	<li>Receive early, constructive feedback from knowledgeable and experienced industry people (including representatives from Mid Atlantic Bio Angels)</li>
 	<li>Potentially connect with advisors/mentors and other team members who may be interested in supporting the company’s efforts and adding value at an early stage.</li>
</ul>
Audience members get to hear how entrepreneurs are pursuing new science and new business opportunities and to provide their own feedback regarding the value and effectiveness of those efforts. The audience votes on a “Best in Show” company which will advance to an annual “Best of the Best/People’s Choice” competition.There is no downside – no investor rejection, no lost opportunities. Just good advice and potential connections that a company can use to improve its strategy and presentation.
