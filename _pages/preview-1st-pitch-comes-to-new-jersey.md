[Originally published on May 5, 2015]

On Wednesday, May 6, <a href="http://1stpitchlifescience.com/">1st Pitch Life Science</a> will be coming to New Jersey! The event, which is organized by the <a href="http://bioangels.net/">Mid Atlantic Bio Angels</a> (MABA), will be held at the <a href="http://www.ilsebio.com/">Institute for Life Science Entrepreneurship</a> (ILSE) on the Keane University campus. Three life science companies will have an opportunity to pitch to a panel of investors and get feedback from both the investors and the audience. At the end of the day, the audience will vote to award the title of "best in show" to the company with the most compelling presentation.

Below are previews for the three presenting companies, which cover a broad range of industries, from pharmaceuticals to telemedicine to medical devices. If you want to learn more about these companies or get more exposure to the pitching process in general, then <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/1st-pitch-life-science-new-jersey-may-6th-2015-tickets-16504982848">register for the event</a> and hear them talk in person!

<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.arkaytherapeutics.com/">ARKAY Therapeutics</a></span></strong>

ARKAY Therapeutics was founded by Dr. Ravi Kumar to develop novel treatments for type 2 diabetes, a disease which affects over 26 million people in the United States alone, and hundreds of millions more across the globe. Due to the complexity of the disease, many patients fail to respond to drugs that are currently on the market, and the threat of severe diabetes-related complications looms large.

Dr. Kumar has decades of experience studying metabolic diseases, both in academia and in the pharmaceutical industry. With ARKAY, his goal is to develop a new paradigm for treatment of type 2 diabetes by utilizing an anti-inflammatory-centric approach. A successful therapy would not only present a new treatment option to the millions suffering from the disease, but would also be a boon to investors, as the global market for type 2 diabetes is over $20 billion and growing.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><a href="http://telenurse.co/">TeleNurse Network</a></strong></span>

The telemedicine industry is expanding rapidly but remains highly fragmented. The TeleNurse Network is seeking to streamline the process by providing patients with a comprehensive telemedicine marketplace. This may decrease readmission into hospitals and promote participation in preventive care.

How does it work? A system using state-of-the-art cameras and software connects patients to nurses, who can provide care and connect them to practitioners if required. This mode of communication is particularly significant for patients who have difficulty traveling, or those in regions where access to nurses and doctors may be inadequate.

While there are similar services available for doctors, there are not currently any telehealth services geared towards nurses, which are playing an increasingly important role in today’s health care environment. TeleNurse Network hopes to fill this gap and become a leader in an industry that is just beginning to hit its stride.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>UltraVision</strong></span>

When doctors and anesthesiologists need to numb a nerve plexus before surgery, they use ultrasound to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab8Dvjauk_U">guide their needle</a> to the correct location. However, once the needle is in place, there is no way to visualize where exactly the fluid is going. This is the problem Dr. Allen Maizes set out to solve when he started UltraVision.

Dr. Maizes designed a new needle that allows visualization of the liquid as it flows out of the tip. While the ultrasound currently used is all grayscale, this new needle allows the liquid to be visualized in color. Importantly, this can all be done using the color doppler feature which is already built into ultrasound machines, meaning that the only additional device required is the needle itself.

While ultrasound has made regional anesthesia easier, needle placement can still be difficult, particularly in obese patients. UltraVision aims to improve the accuracy of needle placement, reducing patients’ recovery time and pain, and doing so in a way that should be accessible and affordable for all doctors.
