Hear what happens AFTER a start-up company presents to an investor group! Usually after the company representatives leave the room, the investors have a private discussion to decide whether the opportunity merits further investigation and possible investment. 1st Pitch Life Science offers presenters and audience members the chance to hear what happens in those closed-door discussions, and to learn what really matters to investors. 1st Pitch Life Science has been organized by MABA (Mid Atlantic Bio Angels (www.bioangels.net), a life science investor group, to encourage and educate aspiring life science entrepreneurs who know they may be too early to seek investment but want the opportunity to practice their pitch and to receive constructive criticism from experienced and knowledgeable professionals.
<h3>Presenting at 1st Pitch Life Science allows early stage life science entrepreneurs to:</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Try out a pitch where no money is immediately at stake</li>
 	<li>Hear what investors and audience members think of their presentation and opportunity</li>
 	<li>Receive early, constructive feedback from knowledgeable and experienced industry people (including representatives from Mid Atlantic Bio Angels)</li>
 	<li>Potentially connect with advisors/mentors and other team members who may be interested in supporting the company’s efforts and adding value at an early stage</li>
</ul>
Audience members get to hear how entrepreneurs are pursuing new science and new business opportunities and to provide their own feedback regarding the value and effectiveness of those efforts. The audience votes on a “Best in Show” company which will advance to an annual “Best of the Best/People’s Choice” competition. Remember, there is no downside – no investor rejection, no lost opportunities. Just good advice and potential connections that a company can use to improve its strategy and presentation.
