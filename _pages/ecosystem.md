No company is an island. To succeed, every startup needs resources - legal, accounting, business, prototyping, trial design, access to talent, etc. Together, these resources form an ecosystem. We created this section in order to make it easy for life science startups to locate the ecosystem resources that they need.

Browse the menu above (or <a href="http://www.1stpitchlifescience.com/category/ecosystem/">click here</a>) to look at all the companies or categories of companies (legal, consulting, etc.) that have joined the 1st Pitch Ecosystem.

We have three Ecosystem options:

<a href="mailto:info@1stpitchlifescience.com"><img class=" wp-image-216 aligncenter" src="http://www.1stpitchlifescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Silver.png" alt="Silver" width="79" height="77" /></a><strong>Silver level membership</strong> - Listing on our Ecosystem with 200 word description, logo, and link to your website. $300/year

<a href="mailto:info@1stpitchlifescience.com"><img class=" size-full wp-image-218 aligncenter" src="http://www.1stpitchlifescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Gold-e1439926754526.png" alt="Gold" width="75" height="77" /></a><strong>Gold (Event) level membership</strong> - Silver membership, plus mention as a sponsor at next 1st Pitch event, plus 2 month listing on our front page. $1000/year

<a href="mailto:info@1stpitchlifescience.com"><img class=" size-full wp-image-215 aligncenter" src="http://www.1stpitchlifescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Platinum-e1439926835713.png" alt="Platinum" width="75" height="76" /></a><strong>Platinum (Primary) level membership</strong> - Gold membership, plus mention as a sponsor at every 1st Pitch event and listing on our front page for one year. $5,000/year

In addition, all ecosystem members will be mentioned in the following email to our list (over 1000 members of the life science community), and all ecosystem members will be part of our scrolling ecosystem and have their logo and name displayed during networking sessions at 1st Pitch Events.

If you are interested in joining the 1st Pitch Ecosystem, please pick one of the subscription options below and send your company information and logo to info@1stpitchlifescience.com.  Once we have received your payment, you will receive an email asking for your logo and a company description which we will then post on our Ecosystem!
