Mid Atlantic Bio Angels group (<span class="caps">MABA</span>), is an angel investor group focused exclusively on new and emerging life science companies. Membership in MABA is by invitation only, and is extended to active, accredited investors (life science angels) who wish to make investments in life science companies, as well as institutional investors and life science company venture arms wishing to invest alongside the angels.

MABA places no geographical restrictions or requirements for presenting companies, as long as meaningful and effective post-investment monitoring of these companies can be achieved. MABA angels meet monthly (except in the summer) in the New York City area, to hear presentations from companies spanning the entire spectrum of life sciences.

If you are interested in submitting an application to present please visit our website, <a href="http://www.bioangels.net">bioangels.net</a>. If you are an accredited and active life science angel investor, and wish to join our group, please visit our <a href="http://bioangels.net/members.php">Members page</a>.
