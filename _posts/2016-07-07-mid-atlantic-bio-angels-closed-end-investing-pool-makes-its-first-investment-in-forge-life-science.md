NEW YORK, July 07, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mid Atlantic Bio Angels (MABA) announces today that its previously announced, closed-end investment pool (Pool) funded solely by current, active MABA members, has made its first investment. The investment, which was joined by several MABA members, was made in FORGE Life Sciences, a Pennsylvania-based company focused on anti-virals.

“This flagship investment for our closed-end pool marks the beginning of what we anticipate will be more frequent investments in life science companies. The pool was formed to enable MABA members to make more frequent initial investments to help companies achieve a milestone which in turn may justify a larger funding commitment by the group. Our members determined that FORGE met our basic investment criteria and wanted to help them move forward,” said Yaniv Sneor, a MABA co-founder and president of Blue Cactus Consulting. “FORGE Life Science has an experienced management and scientific team, and its anti-viral technology represents a significant opportunity in the market.”

<strong>FORGE</strong> has two drug discovery programs applying its broad-spectrum antiviral technology to address clinical challenges currently unmet by direct-acting antiviral strategies: (1) a single pill effective against multiple opportunistic infections including cytomegalovirus, BK virus, and JC virus infections posing serious complications for immunosuppressed patients; and (2) a broad-spectrum flu-antiviral with a reduced acquired resistance profile and effective against seasonal and pandemic influenza strains.
