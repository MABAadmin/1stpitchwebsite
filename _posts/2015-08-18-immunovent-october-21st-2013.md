<div class="mw_release">

NEW YORK, NY--(Marketwired - Oct 21, 2013) - Mid Atlantic Bio Angels (<a href="http://www.bioangels.net/" rel="nofollow">www.bioangels.net</a>) announced today the winner of their second 1<sup>st</sup>Pitch Life Science event, which took place October 2, 2013 in New York, NY. Immunovent, based out of New York City received the title for the "Best in Show" for their well-constructed pitch, innovative product and excellent business model. Immunovent will advance to an annual "Best of the Best/People's Choice" competition along with the "Best in Show" winners from other 1st pitch events.

"My participation in 1<sup>st</sup> Pitch is to help educate both the presenters and the audience about the demands of the angel marketplace. While each of the presenters offered excellent lessons in what to do (or not do) in a pitch, the choice of Immunovent reflected the maturity and substance of its business plan, as well as the presenter's clear answers to some hard questions. The vote reflected the fact that Immunovent is the closest to being 'ready for prime time'," said Stephen M. Goodman, Esq., Partner, Pryor Cashman LLP (NYC), a 1<sup>st</sup> Pitch panelist and one of the founders of MABA.

The winning life science company, Immunovent, is reinventing allergy diagnostics with their Local Allergy Mucosal Brush (LAMB) Test, which identifies local antigen-specific igE not found by skin or blood testing. The LAMB test is the only standardizeable and patient-friendly test for local allergic sensitizations. "The panel of experts and enthusiastic audience participation at 1st Pitch NYC gave us the honest and constructive feedback Immunovent needed to take our presentation of the Local Allergy Mucosal Brush (LAMB) test to the next level," said CSO of Immunovent, Kate Rochlin.

1st Pitch Life Science has been organized by MABA, a life science investor group, to encourage and educate aspiring life science entrepreneurs who know they may be too early to seek investment but want the opportunity to practice their pitch and to receive constructive criticism from experienced and knowledgeable professionals in the industry. Three life science companies were selected to present at the event, which was sponsored by: Anchin, Block &amp; Anchin LLP, McCarter &amp; English, SocialRadius and Yorn.

"Three early stage companies presented creative approaches to solve problems they have identified in their fields of work. The inventors and entrepreneurs are to be congratulated on their efforts. Immunovent demonstrated to the investors and entrepreneurs in the voting audience that they have progressed the furthest. Thanks to Mid Atlantic Bio Angels for organizing the 1st Pitch event," said Martin Phillips, MD, CEO Tarnhelm Therapeutics, 1<sup>st</sup> Pitch panelist and also an investor and Steering Committee member of MABA.

<strong>About Immunovent</strong>

Immunovent is a NYC-based bioventure that is focusing on commercialization of novel technologies for diagnosing allergies. The company is currently developing the Local Allergy Mucosal Brush (LAMB) Test, a technology that emerged from research at the Weill-Cornell College of Medicine. The LAMB test is the first local allergy test that can conveniently and accurately diagnose the ~25% of respiratory and food sensitivities that fail to be detected by traditional skin- and blood-based allergy testing.
