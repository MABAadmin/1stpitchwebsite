PHILADELPHIA, April 28, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mid-Atlantic Bio Angels (MABA) announces today that AsedaSciences, Inc. (<a title="" href="http://globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=JeRKfoaGoa6zKDgCOtb2GM-WGi1Gag4L_cbBJI0zbnfvF_RPTJJD2XFhidSu8cTH_ohfFGSaegsywKaAF2w9dqo6hgAQSJhodjfhUuAV3TI%3D" target="_top" rel="nofollow">http://www.asedasciences.com</a>), a biotechnology company specializing in novel high-throughput protein screening technology and informatics for drug development, was chosen as "Best in Show" at MABA's Philadelphia 1st Pitch Life Science event, which took place at Baker Hostetler on March 26, 2015.

Aseda has developed an unprecedented technology for phenotypic cell screening to help drug companies de-risk potential lead compounds. The company believes its technique is superior in the number of parameters it can measure, simultaneously using a highly reproducible cell model and condensing the resulting data into a simple "index" to allow early go/no go decisions.

"The 1st Pitch Life Sciences event is an invaluable opportunity for any entrepreneur, independent of industry experience. To be able to test your pitch to a committee of potential investors and hear them voice their opinion on your business model, both good and bad, is essential for any entrepreneur," said Brad Calvin, president of Aseda. "From my perspective, their constructive criticism was of most value, allowing us to fine tune our message and build objection handling into our approach. In my opinion, this event should be on every life science start up company's "to do" list."

"1<sup>st</sup> Pitch is hands down the lifeblood of our entrepreneurial ecosystem and an incredibly fun, engaging venue that brings together a myriad cast of characters devoted solely to helping early stage start-ups deliver their perfect elevator pitch," said Heather A. Steinman, a panelist and VP of business development and executive director of technology transfer of the Wistar Institute.

About Mid Atlantic Bio Angels.

At a 1st Pitch event (<a title="" href="http://globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=JeRKfoaGoa6zKDgCOtb2GEnp5G5_Lo3z2ISKKF295WhPtUdDDVtemAECL6tKos0S-En_cSLjjPlAsiTwcGNC2YZpcMVy0OHKftjQOW3YHGkq8RLzOUB4cLws8ZHMbyOz" target="_top" rel="nofollow">http://www.1stpitchlifescience.com</a>), early stage life sciences and healthcare companies make a 15-minute presentation to a panel of experienced life science investors and consultants, followed by a 15-minute audience Q&amp;A. However, where actual investors would then ask the presenting company to leave the room during their subsequent discussion, presenting companies at 1<sup>st</sup>Pitch are invited to hear the panel constructively critique the company's presentation, business model and perceived viability in the market.
