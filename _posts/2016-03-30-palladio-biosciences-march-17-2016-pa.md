<p align="left">PHILADELPHIA, March 30, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mid-Atlantic Bio Angels (MABA) announces today that Palladio Biosciences, Inc. was voted as “Best in Show” at MABA's 1st Pitch Life Science, which took place on March 17, 2016 at the Cira Center in Philadelphia. Palladio Biosciences is a Newtown, PA-based drug development company developing novel disease-modifying drugs for the treatment of Polycystic Kidney Disease, an inherited genetic disease which causes a progressive decline in kidney function.</p>
“Having been chosen as ‘Best in Show’ is encouraging in that knowledgeable investors see promise in our science and unique approach to a shortened approval pathway, extended market exclusivity and the clear need of our drugs for this underserved market,” said Lorenzo Pellegrini, Ph.D., founder and CEO of Palladio Biosciences. “We were delighted by the depth of knowledge of the audience and would like to thank the panel for the quality of their helpful feedback. We believe that we may be able to provide renewed hope to a patient population that has been waiting for too long for effective therapies.”

"While the company is in its early stages, our panel was impressed by the sophistication of both management and Palladio’s approach. The safety and efficacy data for analogue drugs was compelling and clearly establishes acceptable safety and proof of concept, without minimizing potential issues. A well-deserved win," said panelist Bernard Rudnick, co-founder of Mid Atlantic Bio Angels and a Managing Partner of Capgenic Advisors in Delaware.

“Palladio effectively conveyed the scientific evidence supporting their therapeutic hypothesis, as well as the market opportunity,” said Stephen Goodman, another co-founder and a partner at Pryor Cashman LLP in New York City. “The company has laid an excellent foundation for future growth and investment.”
