NEW YORK, April 29, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mid-Atlantic Bio Angels (MABA) announces today that ENB Therapeutics, LLC (<a href="http://www.enbpharma.com">http://www.enbpharma.com</a>) was voted as “Best in Show” at MABA's 1st Pitch Life Science April event, which took place on April 19, 2016 at Medidata Solutions in NYC. ENB Therapeutics develops novel nanoparticle formulations to enhance drug effectiveness and prevent brain metastasis in melanoma patients.

"There are significant gaps in care for melanoma, including a large number of patients with melanoma who are either resistant or non-responsive to existing drugs. We hope to utilize our proprietary formulation of a well-studied molecule and advance the understanding of the role of the endothelin pathway in driving the spread of melanoma in order to introduce a new paradigm to address those gaps, while appropriately balancing risk and capital efficiency,” said Sumayah Jamal, M.D., Ph.D., chief scientific officer and co-founder of ENB Therapeutics, LLC. “We are grateful to MABA and the 1st Pitch NYC panelists for providing us with the opportunity to bring our story to light, as we continue on that journey."

“Sumayah Jamal did a great job engaging with the audience and articulating her company’s technology and its expected path to market. She is clearly passionate about her company and made a compelling presentation which earned her the Best in Show title,” said Yaniv Sneor, MABA co-founder and President of Blue Cactus Consulting.
