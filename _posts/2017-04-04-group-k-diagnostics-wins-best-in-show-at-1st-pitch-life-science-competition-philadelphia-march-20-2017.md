“We were very excited to be chosen as winner of ‘Best in Show’ and ‘Most Fundable,’” said Brianna Wronko, CEO of Group K Diagnostics.  “We believe we fulfill a vital need for a rapid, cost-effective diagnostics for today's patients, providers, and payers, and we appreciate the feedback from MABA as we continue to develop our business and platform in an effort to bring actionable diagnostics directly to the point of care.”

The company strives to solve healthcare practitioners’ need for a versatile diagnostic device while striving for creativity, integrity, patient-centric focus, and continual improvement.

Phillips, MD, CEO, Opsidio, LLC, one of the panelists at the 1<sup>st</sup>Pitch Life Science event.  “Ms. Wronko is using state-of-the-art techniques to develop an inexpensive, portable medical laboratory.”

“This is a really interesting company. The technology is ultraportable and easy to use,” added Ira Wallace, MD, an angel investor and panel member.  “This technology could be the future of diagnostic testing.”

<strong>About 1<sup>st</sup> Pitch Life Science
</strong>At a 1<sup>st </sup>Pitch event (<a title="" href="https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=yrGEXYsbIb_KI-grl_YTRHbKdMvSFHPSM4Xmk8NMeUMKEQskEIE9KlO8lcFUMt5UoFoBx_60tcm9eAa-5nNeDFIkUoQnQU_2hduN_DzE_bO7I17TyzUGP81e6Fc71973" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.1stpitchlifescience.com</a>), early stage life sciences and healthcare companies make a 15-minute presentation to a panel of experienced life science investors and consultants, followed by a 15-minute audience Q&amp;A. However, where actual investors would then ask the presenting company to leave the room during their subsequent discussion, presenting companies at 1<sup>st</sup> Pitch are invited to hear the panel constructively critique the company's presentation, business model and perceived viability in the market.
