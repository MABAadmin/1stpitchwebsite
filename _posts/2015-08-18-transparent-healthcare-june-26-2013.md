<div class="mw_release">

NEW YORK, NY--(Marketwired - Jul 15, 2013) - Mid-Atlantic Bio Angels announced today the winner of the 1<sup>st</sup> Pitch Life Science event, which took place June 26<sup>th</sup> in New York, NY. Transparent Healthcare (THC), based out of Swarthmore, PA, received the title for the "Best in Show" for their well-constructed pitch. The company's mission is to provide affordable access to healthcare to those who find health insurance out of reach or whose benefits have been reduced. "With the uncertainty surrounding Healthcare Reform, more and more companies are looking for alternatives to the high cost of healthcare for their employees. THC offers an affordable, effective solution when health insurance is out of reach," said Betty Heiman, CEO of THC.

The 1<sup>st</sup> Pitch event, held in an 'open-mike' fashion, allows aspiring life science entrepreneurs the opportunity to present their pitch, be critiqued, and win the overall title of "Best in Show". Presenters are also able to gain important insight and constructive feedback to refine their presentation by a panel of knowledgeable and experience people in the life science industry. Attendees of the event included life science professionals from major universities and companies in the area including: NYU, Columbia University, Partnership Fund for New York City, Cold Springs Harbor Laboratory and NYC Tech Connect.

Sponsors for the event ranged from the biomedical industry to the legal industry. "The event provides an excellent platform for emerging companies in the life sciences area to promote themselves and benefit from the feedback provided by the audience and the panel. McCarter's Corporate and IP attorneys regularly assist such companies as they navigate the myriad of legal issues they face -- it was a natural fit to become a sponsor of 1st Pitch," said Lisa Tyner of McCarter &amp; English.

THC has exhibited an already growing internal medical network in the NY, Northern NJ and Metropolitan Georgia areas. The fast developing startup has major expansion plans initially in boosting group sales, later expanding their already growing internal medical network to major regions in order to establish national recognition.

"THC is a genuine example of leadership driven execution. It fits the mold of what gives investors comfort; a plan with contingencies, revenue growth -- diminishing the need for continual investment -- and a well-conceived model and strategy serving a large and tangible unmet need. The company has a first mover advantage and strong alliances, which mitigate investment risks. I believe it will be interesting to our investment community," said Bernard Rudnick, one of MABA's founders as well as a panelist. THC will now advance to an annualÂ "Best of the Best/People's Choice" award competition.
