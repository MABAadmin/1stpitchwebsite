NEW YORK, Oct. 27, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mid-Atlantic Bio Angels (MABA) announces today that Matri-Tek (<a title="www.matritek.com" href="http://www.matritek.com" rel="nofollow">www.matritek.com</a>), a New York-based company that produces tissue-specific matrix biomaterials for life sciences and biomedical research, was named "Best in Show" at MABA's 1st Pitch Life Science event. The 1<sup>st</sup> Pitch Life Science competition was held on October 15, 2015 at the New York Genome Center in New York City.

"This technology could transform the way that drugs are tested <i>in vitro</i>. The opportunity here is without boundaries," said Craig Kenesky, Ph.D., Wilson, Sonsini, Goodrich &amp; Rosati, P.C., who was one of the judges for the 1<sup>st</sup> Pitch competition.

Matri-Tek products are derived from natural organ and tissue sources using their patent-pending methods and contain a wealth of tissue‐specific biochemical factors that make up the native cellular environment.Currently available biomaterials are made from either single biochemical components – like pure collagen, which is too simple to provide cells with a native environment – or are made from a mouse tumor cell line and are not tissue‐specific like Matri-Tek products are.

"The pointed feedback from the investors opened our eyes to strategic partnership opportunities we had not previously considered, and questions from the audience helped us to identify key areas of focus for our business development. 1st Pitch really was a fantastic and beneficial experience," said John O'Neill, founder of Matri-Tek.

About 1<sup>st</sup> Pitch Life Science

At a 1<sup>st</sup> Pitch event (<a title="" href="http://www.1stpitchlifescience.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.1stpitchlifescience.com</a>), early stage life sciences and healthcare companies make a 15-minute presentation to a panel of experienced life science investors and consultants, followed by a 15-minute audience Q&amp;A. However, where actual investors would then ask the presenting company to leave the room during their subsequent discussion, presenting companies at 1<sup>st</sup> Pitch are invited to hear the panel constructively critique the company's presentation, business model and perceived viability in the market.
