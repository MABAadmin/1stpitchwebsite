<p align="left">NEW YORK, Nov. 10, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mid-Atlantic Bio Angels (MABA) announces today that Lynkogen, Inc. and Dina Pharmaceuticals, Inc., were both given the title, “Best in Show” at MABA's 1st Pitch Life Science New Jersey event on November 1, 2016 at the Institute for Life Sciences Entrepreneurship in Union, NJ.  Lynkogen, based in East Windsor, NJ, is developing protein therapeutics for a combination of rare and prevalent metabolic diseases.  Dina Pharma, based in Gladstone, NJ, is researching a novel therapeutic for Parkinson’s disease.</p>
“Dina Pharma is proud to have had the opportunity to present our data at the First Pitch Life Sciences forum. This work was the result of a $1.5M grant from the Michael J. Fox Foundation and collaboration with world renowned experts at Atuka Inc. in Canada. This type of engagement is vital for entrepreneurs and, indeed, the panel of experts’ feedback will help us to refine our message to investors,” said Eboo Versi, M.D., Ph.D., CEO and chairman of Dina Pharmaceuticals, Inc. “We are excited to be developing a novel and unique approach to treating Parkinson’s Disease to benefit patients who deserve a better treatment than what is currently available. Our DAMA therapy combats the symptoms of Parkinson's Disease and results to date strongly suggest this medicine is efficacious both on its own or in combination with L-DOPA, the current gold standard treatment.”

Founded by Dr. Versi, with the help of a team of world-renowned doctors, scientists, and academics, Dina Pharmaceuticals has the singular goal of improving the quality of life of patients suffering from Parkinson's Disease. The company’s lead compound, DPI-289, may have the efficacy of L-DOPA, the current Gold Standard treatment of Parkinson's disease symptoms, but without the debilitating side effect symptoms of dyskinesia that impede the lives of millions of patients worldwide.

“We are grateful for the insights from the audience and investors and are very honored to receive this recognition further validating our strategy,” said Arun Swaminathan, Ph.D., CEO and co-founder of Lynkogen Inc. “Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) is a growing epidemic driven by increased prevalence of obesity and diabetes and is expected to be the leading cause of liver transplants by 2020.  There is an urgent need for therapies to address this devastating disease and manage the underlying cause.  We are committed to developing LYN-100 for obese and diabetic patients suffering from NASH and strive to address this high unmet need.”

Lynkogen Inc. is a pre-clinical stage biotech company whose vision is to develop transformative protein therapeutics for devastating rare and prevalent metabolic diseases. Lynkogen is committed to advancing the lead candidate LYN-100 for the potential treatment of NASH, obesity and diabetes, and generating a pipeline focused on meeting unmet needs in metabolic diseases.

“Both Lynkogen and Dina provided viable business plans combined with excellent science that made it difficult for the audience to choose a single winner.  We were impressed with both companies and look forward to seeing each one continue with its scientific and corporate development,” commented Yaniv Sneor, MABA Co-founder and President of Blue Cactus Consulting.

“This is only the second time in its four-year history that a 1<sup>st</sup> Pitch Life Sciences event has resulted in a tie vote,” said Stephen M. Goodman, a co-founder of MABA and a partner at the law firm of Pryor Cashman LLP in New York City. “Both Lynkogen and Dina made dynamic presentations for innovative scientific ideas and demonstrated a willingness to listen carefully to questions and comments.  The combination bodes well for the future of each company.”

<strong>About 1<sup>st</sup> Pitch Life Science
</strong>At a 1<sup>st</sup>Pitch event (<a title="" href="https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=JYqdQo9ktpMuBdrLXhenWXkYeRuO7rp7SV3Kkm6cMfgJloITMjTtzUBbhwMvqAUjWCYWNz6Gq8QK3gthUP-iMtuzM5czDZSWdlUORBhJ9noJF9eP70dXJNg-jnniOREy" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.1stpitchlifescience.com</a>), early stage life sciences and healthcare companies make a 15-minute presentation to a panel of experienced life science investors and consultants, followed by a 15-minute audience Q&amp;A. However, where actual investors would then ask the presenting company to leave the room during their subsequent discussion, presenting companies at 1<sup>st</sup> Pitch are invited to hear the panel constructively critique the company's presentation, business model and perceived viability in the market.
