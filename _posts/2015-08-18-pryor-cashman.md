The <a href="http://www.pryorcashman.com/practices-78.html">Life Sciences Practice at Pryor Cashman</a> has more than 30 years of experience addressing the challenges facing entrepreneurs and early-stage businesses in this industry, as well as counseling many established, start-up and mid-stage companies.  As a result of our long-standing relationships with leaders in the commercial and academic sectors of the life sciences community, we are intimately familiar with the many considerations that drive our clients’ decisions and are known for our quick-thinking and creative handling of complex challenges, our continuous accessibility, our practicality and our cost-sensible solutions.  We assist our life sciences clients across the entire spectrum of  their development – from raising funds to organizing their companies, structuring their operations and acquiring other businesses. Our deep understanding of intellectual property helps clients take full advantage of laws designed to protect their inventions, to purchase or sell rights in innovative technologies, and to structure relationships for developing or exploiting their intellectual property assets through licensing and cross-licensing arrangements.
