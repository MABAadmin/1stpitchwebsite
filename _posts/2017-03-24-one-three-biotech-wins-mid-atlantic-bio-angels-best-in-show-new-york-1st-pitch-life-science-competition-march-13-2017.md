<p align="left">NEW YORK, March 23, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mid Atlantic Bio Angels (MABA) announces today that OneThree Biotech (OneThree), a New York-based company developing artificial intelligence technology to more rapidly identify drug targets and side effects, was named “Best in Show” at MABA's 1st Pitch Life Science event on March 13, 2017 at Weill Cornell Medical Center in New York City.</p>
"Presenting at 1st Pitch was an amazing opportunity to obtain candid investor feedback, which will dramatically shape our business development going forward,” said Neel Madhukar, CEO of OneThree Biotech.“We left even more determined to use artificial intelligence to change the way drugs are discovered and developed.  We were honored to have been selected as the 'Best in Show.'”

“OneThree’s unique technology has the potential to streamline the new drug approval process through early identification of potential delivery targets and side effects,” said David Broderick, partner at the law firm of McCarter &amp; English, LLP.

OneThree Biotech is developing an artificial intelligence platform to more rapidly identify drug targets.  Unlike other approaches, OneThree’s platform uses its novel algorithms to combine diverse data types beyond the molecular structure of the drug in question.  This allows the platform to more accurately identify targets and side effects (up to 90 percent accuracy) with greater flexibility and speed.

<strong>About 1<sup>st</sup> Pitch Life Science
</strong>At a 1<sup>st </sup>Pitch event (<a title="" href="https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=2DN_K5pJYbfl6bV9aBpPBYjy4wOO2azVADOkBvZ6gkFoMhquXLQj2CoWPSKCsbkM8Zmk6PCIkEbK_7GeDeLCXdexYBGbcxb_vtZk-OIq1jJG7MhuZJTgIOYWo9afP1uk" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.1stpitchlifescience.com</a>), early stage life sciences and healthcare companies make a 15-minute presentation to a panel of experienced life science investors and consultants, followed by a 15-minute audience Q&amp;A. However, where actual investors would then ask the presenting company to leave the room during their subsequent discussion, presenting companies at 1<sup>st</sup> Pitch are invited to hear the panel constructively critique the company's presentation, business model and perceived viability in the market.
