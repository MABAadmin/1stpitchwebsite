<div class="mw_release">

NEW YORK, NY--(Marketwired - Dec 19, 2013) - Mid-Atlantic Bio Angels (MABA) announced today that Oculogica, Inc., a NYC-based medical device company, won "Best in Show" at MABA's 1<sup>st</sup> Pitch Life Science event on December 4<sup>th</sup> in New York, NY. Oculogica is developing unique eye tracking technology designed to assist in the diagnosis of concussive brain trauma. Its technology is currently being tested in multiple hospitals including Brigham and Women's Hospital, NorthShore University Health System and UW Medicine Harborview Medical Center.

"We received excellent feedback which will enable us to approach investors with better preparation," said Oculogica co-founders Robert Ritlop and Dr. Uzma Samadani. "In addition we made several valuable contacts, as the format allowed sufficient time for people to understand and appreciate our value proposition. We thank 1st Pitch for providing us with an opportunity to present to a large, investment savvy, experienced sounding board."

1st Pitch Life Science is organized by MABA, a life science angel investor group, to encourage and educate aspiring life science companies that may not be ready to seek investment but want the opportunity to practice their pitch and receive constructive criticism from an experienced and knowledgeable panel of professionals in the industry. At each event, three life science companies are selected to present their pitch, field audience questions, and receive panelist feedback. The event is currently held at the offices of Anchin, Block &amp; Anchin LLP, 1<sup>st</sup> Pitch sponsors. The December 4 event, the third in the bi-monthly series, drew over 120 attendees from the East Coast life science community, including from major institutions such as NYU, Columbia University, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, and others.

Panelist and MABA co-founder Stephen M. Goodman, a partner at the law firm of Pryor Cashman LLP in New York, stated, "Of the three presenting companies, Oculogica clearly had the most cogent presentation. While its business model is still a work in progress, as news reports indicate, there is a clear market need for the information they are generating regarding the consequences of brain trauma such as concussions. The company shows great promise for delivering this information in a user-friendly way to clinicians and others."

"In my view, Oculogica's product has the potential to transform standard screening procedures in the case of suspected concussions and other brain injuries by providing a rapid, relatively inexpensive diagnostic tool that has the potential to shorten considerably the time between injury and diagnosis," said David Broderick, Partner at McCarter &amp; English LLP. "In addition, I was particularly impressed by the potential use of their system to monitor concussion patients on an ongoing basis to determine when they can safely return to work, school or the playing field, for which there is no current defined protocol."

Oculogica will now advance to an annual "Best of the Best/People's Choice" award competition.

<strong>About Oculogica Inc.</strong>

Oculogica is a medical startup developing a diagnostic device that detects and quantitates the extent of concussion, structural brain injury and other diseases affecting brain function. Unlike imaging studies, which reveal what the brain looks like, Oculogica's EyeBoxCNS technology captures how well it functions by quantitating specific aspects of eye movements measured while someone watches television or a video for just a few mintues. Preliminary data suggests that while normal peoples' eyes move in near perfect synchrony, people with structural or non-structural (concussive) brain injury have eyes that do not move together. Oculogica believes their technology will help evaluate treatments for concussion as well as determining when brain injured people can return to work or play.

The EyeBoxCNS technology features a four-minute test that is safe and non-invasive. It provides vital information for critical diagnoses in the emergency room and will ultimately be used in places like the home, the sports field/arena and the battlefield.
