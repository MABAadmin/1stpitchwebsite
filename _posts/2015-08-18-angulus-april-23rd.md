<h1>Angulus Wins Mid-Atlantic Bio Angels 1st Pitch Life Science Competition</h1>
<strong>The Medtech Startup Is Chosen as "Best in Show" for Their Outstanding Presentation and Innovative Product</strong>
<div class="mw_release">

NEW YORK, NY--(Marketwired - May 8, 2014) - Mid-Atlantic Bio Angels (MABA) announced today that Angulus, a New York area company developing a device for reducing the incidence of ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP), was chosen as "best in show" at MABA's 1st Pitch Life Science event, which took place April 23rd.

The Angulus product is a simple and easy-to-implement compact device that attaches to a patient's chest and continuously monitors the patient's angle of inclination. If the patient deviates from the elevation guidelines, a signal alerts the nursing station. The device is also able to provide alerts when patients slide down the bed. The goal of positioning patients within a target recumbency range is to decrease the incidence of Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia. CEO Frank Glaser presented the company to a panel of leaders in the life science industry.

"This was a terrific event organized by MABA and sponsors," said CEO Frank Glaser. "My team tapped into valuable healthcare entrepreneurship networks and received both validation and feedback from the panel."

Mr. Glaser continued, "The shift towards value-based reimbursement has shed light on major inefficiency and need in the hospital space. As clinicians, we need to roll up our sleeves and solve problems like hospital-acquired infections. We hope to do precisely that for Ventilator Associated Pneumonia with Angulus." Angulus believes that there is a significant need to develop innovations that aid providers in complying with difficult-to-manage guidelines. Improper head of bed elevation has become a core challenge for hospitals as it leads to increased incidences of VAP, lengthening ICU stay by more than 4 days and costing an extra $40,000 per patient on average.

The 1<sup>st</sup> Pitch format generally follows MABA's angel group meeting format with one important exception. In both instances, invited companies make a 15-minute presentation, followed by 15 minutes of audience Q&amp;A. However, instead of asking the presenting company to leave the room during the subsequent investment discussion by MABA investors, after a 1<sup>st</sup> Pitch presentation, presenting companies are invited to hear the panel of investors as they constructively dissect the company's presentation, as well as its business model.

Martin D. Phillips, MD, CEO, Tarnhelm Therapeutics and a member of the panel, stated, "Congratulations to the Angulus team. They demonstrated to the audience a lot of the characteristics of successful entrepreneurs: clarity of thought, depth of understanding of what it takes to develop a new product, all using minimal resources. It is rewarding to see this talent in the next generation of bio-entrepreneurs."

About Angulus
Angulus is positioned to solve the problem of Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia, a cause of morbidity and mortality across ICU units. Guidelines recommend that ventilated patients be positioned at 30 to 45 degrees in order to reduce the risk of VAP, but compliance among providers remains poor. Furthermore, patients often slide down hospital beds, mitigating the benefit of head of bed angle compliance. Based on IP owned by the company, Angulus is the only device that attaches to the patient's chest wall, evaluates real-time patient angle, and integrates with existing ICU systems to signal providers when patients slide outside of the desired recumbency. Angulus is currently preparing for initial pilot studies to assess use of the device in the clinical setting.
