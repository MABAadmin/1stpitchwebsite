NEW YORK, Nov. 24, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mid-Atlantic Bio Angels (MABA) announces today that PathoVax, LLC. (<a title="www.pathovax.com" href="http://www.pathovax.com" rel="nofollow">www.pathovax.com</a>), a Maryland-based company that is developing a unique vaccine against human papillomavirus (HPV), was named "Best in Show" at MABA's 1st Pitch Life Science New Jersey event on November 11, 2015. The 1<sup>st</sup> Pitch Life Science New Jersey competition was held at the Institute for Life Science Entrepreneurship in Union, NJ.

"PathoVax made a well-thought-out, concise and engaging presentation in support of their RGVax HPV vaccine and easily earned the "Best In Show" award. Both their technology and market approach appear promising, and we hope that they will achieve commercial success," said Yaniv Sneor, MABA co-founder, president of Blue Cactus Consulting and a panelist at the event.

According to PathoVax, its technology, RGVax, a broad spectrum HPV vaccine is expected to provide protection against all clinically relevant HPV types. The company's goal is to address the devastating economic burden, social stigma, costly manufacturing, and poor compliance rates resulting from the recognized limitations and incomplete protection of current HPV vaccines. The company cites pre-clinical published studies as demonstrating that the RGVax prototype utilizes similar technology as approved vaccines to conserve safety profiles, yet provides protection against at least 27 HPVs, including all 15 high-risk cervical cancer-causing types, with one VLP.

In addition, PathoVax reports that the National Cancer Institute has awarded a multi-million dollar grant to the RGVax inventors to accelerate the RGVax technology to human clinical trials. RGVax's superior properties are expected to favor rapid market uptake in a $2 billion annual revenue segment with strategic partnerships. PathoVax is also in the process of engaging firms to bring onboard innovative platforms to tackle other major issues facing vaccine distribution.

"We are grateful for the opportunity to present to a group of highly experienced and knowledgeable industry veterans at 1<sup>st</sup> Pitch. As a young biotech vaccine company that recognizes the hurdles in bringing biologics to market, we appreciate the insightful feedback that'll help refine our business strategy," said Joshua Wang, co-founder of PathoVax. "It was also tremendously beneficial to obtain an insight into the decision making process for seasoned biotech investors during the due-diligence process."

About 1<sup>st</sup> Pitch Life Science

At a 1<sup>st</sup> Pitch event (<a title="" href="http://www.1stpitchlifescience.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.1stpitchlifescience.com</a>), early stage life sciences and healthcare companies make a 15-minute presentation to a panel of experienced life science investors and consultants, followed by a 15-minute audience Q&amp;A. However, where actual investors would then ask the presenting company to leave the room during their subsequent discussion, presenting companies at 1<sup>st</sup> Pitch are invited to hear the panel constructively critique the company's presentation, business model and perceived viability in the market.
