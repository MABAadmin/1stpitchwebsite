<p align="left">NEW YORK, May 01, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mid-Atlantic Bio Angels (MABA) announces today that BioCurrent Technologies (BioCurrent), a microbe-based, sustainable nanomaterials company, was named “Best in Show” by the audience and “Most Fundable” by the investor panel at MABA's 1st Pitch Life Science New Jersey event held on April 18, 2017 at Rutgers University in Piscataway, N.J.</p>
"We were very excited to be selected for 1<sup>st</sup> Pitch Life Science and even more excited to have been selected as both Best in Show and Most Fundable. We learned a lot from both the excellent panel as well as the thoughtful questions from the audience, and are grateful to our team, including David Howard and Matthew Chiusano from Ramapo College, who helped us develop our presentation,” said Mark Miller, CEO of BioCurrent. “We were focused primarily on our microbial derived biowires as replacements for carbon and silicon nanotubes. Now we will refocus more on end-user applications using their unique characteristics as a solution to issues with current technologies."

Based in Saddle River, N.J., BioCurrent Technologies is developing natural biowire technologies to replace environmentally harmful, finite and expensive nanotubes and other nanotechnologies. Nanowires are typically produced using finite materials such as silicon and graphite in a chemically intensive and environmentally damaging process. The company’s natural biowires can be mass-produced from inexpensive, renewable, and sustainable microbes and manufactured with much lower energy requirements. The resulting biowires provide performance equal to conventional nanowires, with the added advantage of being able to control the conductivity level. Finally, microbial biowires have a naturally high aspect ratio (very small diameter and long wire length) so they can be tailored to fit the application i.e. cut to specific lengths. Derived from the geobacter microbe, the company has developed a proprietary methodology to create sustainable and cost effective components.

“BioCurrent Technologies is developing naturally-derived nanowires that may replace harmful and costly conventional nanotechnology and could be alternative components for electronic devices,” said Carolyn Meyers, principal, BioEnsemble, Ltd., and a member of the MABA panel.  “This was a unique early stage technology and I was intrigued by its potential use in novel therapeutics.”

<strong>About 1<sup>st</sup> Pitch Life Science
</strong>At a 1<sup>st </sup>Pitch event (<a title="" href="https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=BaCQ5L8CF-a2T7W_XdvfD7O1tV2BOdKRY4l1l1VZnzfhxis-nSOUEH0tDt5aY2mitpx_zIYdjS5ULW9gw4MLoGKnrIGEAJAfF5F9NvFPx8aJM2GkuLe8lTxatXS4qzxc" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">http://www.1stpitchlifescience.com</a>), early stage life sciences and healthcare companies make a 15-minute presentation to a panel of experienced life science investors and consultants, followed by a 15-minute audience Q&amp;A. However, where actual investors would then ask the presenting company to leave the room during their subsequent discussion, presenting companies at 1<sup>st</sup> Pitch are invited to hear the panel constructively critique the company's presentation, business model and perceived viability in the market.

<strong>About MABA
</strong>Mid Atlantic Bio Angels (<a title="" href="https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=BaCQ5L8CF-a2T7W_XdvfD1UDj-i8uEzxeEuomro-EVF3g_lDj7-RF7xMpiXcUDMMaVJ_1M5xygcAjM18VizM5A==" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">http://bioangels.net</a>) is a group of active angel investors, which meets in New York City monthly (except July and August) solely to hear from pre-screened early-stage life science companies. MABA members consist of individuals from Delaware to Massachusetts with significant expertise and experience in the biotechnology, pharmaceutical and healthcare industries, including former and current corporate executives, doctors and Ph.D. scientists with product development backgrounds, successful medical entrepreneurs and analyst/investors focused on life sciences. MABA's goal is to create an environment where the depth of investors' knowledge coupled with the pre-screening of presenting companies enhances the potential for meaningful investment.
