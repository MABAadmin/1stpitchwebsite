<div class="spacer">NEW YORK, Nov. 11, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mid-Atlantic Bio Angels (MABA) announces today that VakSea, Inc. was named “Best in Show” at MABA's inaugural 1st Pitch Life Science Baltimore event on October 26, 2016 at the Institute for Marine and Environmental Technology Center (IMET –<a title="" href="https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=bZbyekm3206ZgLytKsVssWJEVJ9LMrPYKfHThzQUyGKTr48FezKPTL5drOVFfLZFMZCA8CcrDEGcTrfYNVFuQQ==" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://imet.usmd.edu</a>) located in Baltimore, MD.  VakSea is a Baltimore-based company developing oral vaccines against nervous necrosis virus in aquaculture.</div>

“We are very proud of our technology and believe that it has tremendous potential to improve conditions within aquaculture,” commented Dr. Nick Hammond of VakSea, Inc. “We are extremely grateful for the recognition we received from Mid Atlantic Bio Angels and the panel, and look forward to continuing to develop our technology and our business model using the learnings from this event.”

The company is focused on developing oral vaccines for commonly occurring viruses in aquaculture.   Large farmed fish are subject to a wide range of diseases because of their unnatural close quarters.  Illness spread by these conditions results in as much as a billion dollars in losses each year.  VakSea’s unique approach to manufacturing oral vaccines is intended to provide a cost effective solution.

"The three 1st Pitch presenters were compelling and described very different entrepreneurial opportunities to a packed house. I have no doubt that the challenging questions from the audience and the panel of investors led to considerable learning by all in attendance,” said Paul Silber, founding principal of Blu Venture Investors, and a panelist at the event. “Dr. Nick Hammond's pitch for startup VakSea was selected as the audience favorite and winner; the company is working on an innovative oral vaccine for use in aquaculture."

<strong>About 1<sup>st</sup> Pitch Life Science
</strong>At a 1<sup>st</sup>Pitch event (<a title="" href="https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=bZbyekm3206ZgLytKsVssdxK45O_YnBgg6KU9B0vum7yH4oWQwWMenh3xF1LeroK2745nEb1qJ6pYon2fM5kvtulMkvcCOWzZ7-7bthfBb3Jx64ZY45hSsGyzidREz0x" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.1stpitchlifescience.com</a>), early stage life sciences and healthcare companies make a 15-minute presentation to a panel of experienced life science investors and consultants, followed by a 15-minute audience Q&amp;A. However, where actual investors would then ask the presenting company to leave the room during their subsequent discussion, presenting companies at 1<sup>st</sup>Pitch are invited to hear the panel constructively critique the company's presentation, business model and perceived viability in the market.
